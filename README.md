## Background

With the ever increasing technological advancement in the last decade, it is possible to
incorporate machine learning tasks dealing with images as the main object of interest. As a
result, this allows for more problems related to image, art, or content creation to be solved
programmatically and even more efficiently. For example, the problem of automated image
labelling can be solved by utilizing image captioning models. Another example, the problem of
reading handwritten numbers can be solved by utilizing image classification models.

The problem this project is trying to address is the difficulty of digital content creation, focusing on applying filters, for non art-savvy individuals. Imagine a scenario where an individual is tasked to apply a filter, for example Van Gogh’s ​The Starry Night ​painting, to an image. This task may not be as challenging for art-savvy individuals since they are able to either utilize existing art software such as photoshop to produce the requirement, or paint the image such that it fulfills the requirement. However, this will be a huge challenge for those who are not as adept to the process.

This is where this project, image style transfer model, can come in to help those non art-savvy individuals complete the task through some computing. To be more
specific, this project focus on universal image style transfer model, which will be able to
apply the style of any style images to any input content images.
